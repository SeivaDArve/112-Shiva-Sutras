Seiva Descriptions {

   SS #15 {

      Explanation from Nithyananda why some enlightned masters sever limbs of their disciples to get them enlightened:
         (he gives the meaning of tapas): - Tapas: Ready to work on the technique at any cost, any risk
                                          - Therefore this techmique is only for those whom enlightenment becomes FIRST priority

      A very good explanation of Maya is found in the video where Nithyananda explains this sutra
         (video: "Just Fall In - Shiva Sutras in Nithyananda Videos"; URL: https://youtu.be/Gkp2p7JVLB)
   }

   SS #25: Seiva created a script to ring a bell randomly at any time within 24 hours, and the person who is aware of the script/program, will stop as soon as the bell is rang. So, after this, there is a question... what to do if you stop and then you have the inpulse again of continuing your life and do something? Well, we must undertand that this sutra is a technique and is meant for you to be aware if the stopping, it is not for you to become lazy... therefore you definitly will continue with your life at some point. If life is really flowing and if at some point you feel yhat your life is goung to continue, than keep up the game of the shiva sutras (as per SS #110: "Gracious one, play...") and the script will suggest the sutra #108 to you the player where, before you continue to run your life, first you see where the flow of life is trying to pull you thowards

   SS #27: Maybe this is the origin of the Dance "Shiva Tandava"

   SS #29: Do you feel stuck somewhere or wuth something? devote yourself to the process, are you in jain? devote yourself to the process, devotions frees. Sadhguru sais in Inner Engeneer ans in Shambavi: "All the rules are my rules". Devotion may make you feel smaller, seeing everything bugger that you, in case your handcuffs start increasing in size where you are smaller and smaller, suddenly they may loose grip or your hands ang you may escape. God is definitly bigger, right?

   SS #35: In one sentence what I would say is: "Notice depth... either if it is a well of if it is masters's eyes"

   SS #35: Jusy as Lao Tzu taught his disciple: stay on this bridge and do not go out until river stops and bridgr moves.. At that moment you know the yin yang... but further continuing, go on changing your prespective from yin to yang, from yang to yin, from yin to yang until you see the snake wich is sushumna... the edge of the bridge will not be a straight line if you keep changing you eyes from yin to yang, yang to yin... your eyes will like you are drunk. Bridge moving + river sptoped = Ida. Bridge flowing + River moving = Pingala. The edge that separates both can be a fixed surface or a wave form, that is sushumna

   SS #101: Seiva translates this sutra as: "Believe omniscient, omnipotent, permeating, perculating everywhere.." And when we deal with dumb people from the village, we feel the lack of knowing from them, like if inteligence is not yet reaching it's depts.... Another way of seeing this dumb people with stone like brains is to see that their rock like brain is a building block for a bigger scale of "small" particles that we, the observer, cannot yet step in because we are too thin for this rock like scale 

   SS #106: Sadhguru explains this sutra in inner engeneering as: "I am responsible for everything"

   SS #108: The TAO, Wu-Wei is the allowance of the individual for the body to freely float along the river... if you leave your body to float with the river, you experience one level of Wu-wei, the TAO... the same way... if you perceive your body's tendencies and routines as if you are simply watching a log of a tree floating along the path of least resistence, now, you see the spirit of guidance... Osho describes in his experience of enlightenment "I felt the power of God, I was not there, God was there... and I went at 1 am in yhr night to a garden where I used to go and I climbed the gate as a thief, I had to do it, I was nit there, God was there". (Osho Words are not those exactly, please watch: https://youtu.be/oqXYUiWVlkU)

   SS #109: Salvia divinorum gives you this one

   SS #112: This sutra describes what Nithyananda calls "Kailash"

   Names of shiva: "Asudosha: Easily pleased (meaning that you don't need much to please him)"

   Seiva Sais: I don't know if this sutra is sutable for what sadhguru says os not. BUT... If the sutra mentions the living presence of the cosmos, then I think this sutra is sutable for the question to sadhguru about what to do with mountain sized karmas. He's answer about huge amounts of karma was: " -Even if you himalayan size karma, inverse the equation and use this complexity.... instead of passion thowards you and dispassion toward other, no..... total passion about everything else (every other life), total dispassion about this one (refering to ourself)" - Video: With sadhguru in challenging times - day22 Apr""

Shiva Sutra #7 {
   > With intangible breath in center of forehead, as this reaches the heart at the moment of sleep, have direction over dreams and over death itself.

   video by Nithyananda: "Shiva Sutras Death Demystified" (https://youtu.be/beqUPL4Y2tg)

   - This sutra explains perfectly what by mistake, Seiva experienced at the hospital during army burnout. He tried this sutra during the night and he experienced the death state, he experienced 2 realities at the same time

   Nithyananda: "prana means air energy"
   
   Seiva: something to try: did you ever see a kid trying to sleep sitting down with its head straight? and starting to hit the wall with the head over and over and over? Well: at the moment where you feel so sleepy that your neck starts to wave like a snake, do the sutra. At that moment, head is free falling... stopping... free falling... stopping... yin... yang... yin... yang... ... KEEP YOUR REMAINING wakefull attention in such free fall

   Nithyananda YouTube video {
      Nithyananda, while explaining SS #17, explains "this moment is inevitable" as taught by Sadhguru in inner engeneering and shambavi

Shiva Sutra #20 {
   Seiva says: Fill the whole car like a statue, still, if you keep you center of mass in line between a strong base and a light head, experience. When you cook bread and you swirl the bread around the container with a certain amount of flour, the uncooked bread can experience the same as you. For the second part of the sutra, you can watch toy story movie at the part where Jessie introduces woody. The woodie's walk with style is an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkojrVKj-s
   seiva says: "in a stil vehicle, in slowing invisible circles" I think it means that the vehicle must have springs yo bounce a little bit
   
   Seiva says: Vivekananda got enlightened by his guru with this technique: the guru asked if the had the courage to sit. vivekanada sat and the guru put one feet one his chest. by rithmically swaying him, the experience. video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pviWGX7bLF4
}
Shiva Sutra #25 {
   Nithyananda sais at the video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq0V-seTR2I": "Patanjali says: Just sit straight and you will enter into meditation"

   Sadhguru tells the story how Ashtavakra Enlightened the king Janaka: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24HmHvT6M04" (when comming down the horse, stoped at one leg up, one leg down)
   
   # uDev: Create a script at home stereo system: Randomly whistle a sound. The moment you listen to the sound, you must STOP completly without adjusting! (Just like Nithyananda told in his video). Sugestion for sound: rattle snake sound
