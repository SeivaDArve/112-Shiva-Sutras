Seiva Descriptions {

      SS #112: This sutra describes what Nithyananda calls "Kailash"

   SS #35: In one sentence what I would say is: "Notice depth... either if it is a well of if it is masters's eyes"

   Names of shiva: "Asudosha: Easily pleased (meaning that you don't need much to please him)"

   SS #15 {

      Explanation from Nithyananda why some enlightned masters sever limbs of their disciples to get them enlightened:
         (he gives the meaning of tapas): - Tapas: Ready to work on the technique at any cost, any risk
                                          - Therefore this techmique is only for those whom enlightenment becomes FIRST priority

      A very good explanation of Maya is found in the video where Nithyananda explains this sutra

   Seiva Sais: I don't know if this sutra is sutable for what sadhguru says os not. BUT... If the sutra mentions the living presence of the cosmos, then I think this sutra is sutable for the question to sadhguru about what to do with mountain sized karmas. He's answer about huge amounts of karma was: " -Even if you himalayan size karma, inverse the equation and use this complexity.... instead of passion thowards you and dispassion toward other, no..... total passion about everything else (every other life), total dispassion about this one (refering to ourself)" - Video: With sadhguru in challenging times - day22 Apr""

Shiva Sutra #7 {
   > With intangible breath in center of forehead, as this reaches the heart at the moment of sleep, have direction over dreams and over death itself.

   video by Nithyananda: "Shiva Sutras Death Demystified" (https://youtu.be/beqUPL4Y2tg)

   - This sutra explains perfectly what by mistake, Seiva experienced at the hospital during army burnout. He tried this sutra during the night and he experienced the death state, he experienced 2 realities at the same time

   Nithyananda: "prana means air energy"
   
   Seiva: something to try: did you ever see a kid trying to sleep sitting down with its head straight? and starting to hit the wall with the head over and over and over? Well: at the moment where you feel so sleepy that your neck starts to wave like a snake, do the sutra. At that moment, head is free falling... stopping... free falling... stopping... yin... yang... yin... yang... ... KEEP YOUR REMAINING wakefull attention in such free fall

   Sadhguru tells the story how Ashtavakra Enlightened the king Janaka: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24HmHvT6M04" (when comming down the horse, stoped at one leg up, one leg down)
   
   # uDev: Create a script at home stereo system: Randomly whistle a sound. The moment you listen to the sound, you must STOP completly without adjusting! (Just like Nithyananda told in his video). Sugestion for sound: rattle snake sound
