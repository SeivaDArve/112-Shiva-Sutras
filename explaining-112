Seiva Sais:

SS #112: This sutra describes what Nithyananda calls "Kailash"

SS #35: In one sentence what I would say is: "Notice depth... either if it is a well of if it is masters's eyes"

Names of shiva: "Asudosha: Easily pleased (meaning that you don't need much to please him)"

SS #15 {

   Explanation from Nithyananda why some enlightned masters sever limbs of their disciples to get them enlightened:
      (he gives the meaning of tapas): - Tapas: Ready to work on the technique at any cost, any risk
                                       - Therefore this techmique is only for those whom enlightenment becomes FIRST priority

   A very good explanation of Maya is found in the video where Nithyananda explains this sutra
