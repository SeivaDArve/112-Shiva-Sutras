Seiva Descriptions {

      SS #112: This sutra describes what Nithyananda calls "Kailash"

   SS #35: In one sentence what I would say is: "Notice depth... either if it is a well of if it is masters's eyes"

   Names of shiva: "Asudosha: Easily pleased (meaning that you don't need much to please him)"

   SS #15 {

      Explanation from Nithyananda why some enlightned masters sever limbs of their disciples to get them enlightened:
         (he gives the meaning of tapas): - Tapas: Ready to work on the technique at any cost, any risk
                                          - Therefore this techmique is only for those whom enlightenment becomes FIRST priority

      A very good explanation of Maya is found in the video where Nithyananda explains this sutra
