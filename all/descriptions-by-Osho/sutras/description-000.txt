Vigyan Bhairav Tantra (Technique: 000 of 112) 

Parvati asks: 
   O Shiva, what is your reality?
   What is this wonder-filled universe?
   What constitutes seed?
   Who centers the universal wheel?
   What is this life beyond form pervading forms?
   How may we enter it fully,
   above space and time,
   names and descriptions?
   Let my doubts be cleared!
