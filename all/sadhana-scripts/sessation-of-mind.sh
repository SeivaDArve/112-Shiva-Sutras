# Title: Script to create sessation of mind
# Describe: Few discourses will happen in intervals. Each discourse is small like 4 minutes (from Nithyananda). In between each discurse, 1 minute will happen in silence. In such silence, do not move your mind. As nithyananda says: There is no problem if you don't understand his words, the only problem is if he does not speak, we start speaking in our minds.
# Video that explains and empowers this one script: https://youtu.be/f-YYdn0BIqc
# uDev: The Nithyananda's discourse "Sitting in Silence - Short Nithyananda Videos" is a small part of a bigger video. That video needs to mentioned here.
