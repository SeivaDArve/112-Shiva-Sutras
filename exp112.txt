NOTE: Nithyananda says: "The message of the Shiva Sutras is: You are Divinity!"
NOTE: Shiva Sutras connect us with the three aspects of Shiva within us: Satyam (the truth), Shivam (the goodness), Sundaram (the beauty).

Seiva sobre liberation/liberdade/mukti/aghora: Quando alguém te contradizer quando afirmas que poucas pessoas sao independentes incluindonessas peara quem falas. Prova-lhes que não sao independentes e que não atinjiram mukti... puxa do vomito e vê se elas vão atras de ti... se forem atras de ti, não estao em mukti

NOTE: By going fiercely into each technique, applying your energy there, then you are starting the destruction process. Distruction is needed to create something new. Shiva is the destroyer... Nithyananda sais renunciation is needed only for the things you don't have. Do not renouce the things you have, only the things you don't have... If you go deep in each technique renoucing and destroying the inner chattering about the things you don't have, then you are shiva. - Seiva
NOTE: Shiva Sutras are not filosophies, because philosophi does not give solutions, it only mentions problems and questions.
NOTE: Sound of bansuri in Nithyananda Videos: Pleasing the Lord - Shivranjani (feat. Rakesh Chaurasia) - Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia

   SS #2: It is a sutra tha will manifest when you drop your identity if is fully social. So in order for best practice I suggest taking a small trip the the woods in the morning when the atmosphere ia little colder than the body and little unconfortable, and in such place, empty of social distractions and demanding of you to evaporate your temperature, drop all of your clothes and relax! If somebody appraches the place, if you feel these woods are not governamental place you somebody else propriety, you don't even have to feel afraid of your security, relax and meet them this way

   SS #4: Shiva Sutra responsavel pelo meu bufo alvarius "when it is all out and stops by itself" "dificult only if you thinks it is dificult because it is not". I had a dream where I was jumping around in a ceramic floored garden with waterfalls and in one of my jumps on the starcase, I was slow looking at the step below and could not find the ground and started falling in sky diving mode. In this dive, My eyes started looking correctly to the ground and calculating the impact time. During the fall I felt the adrenaline of falling and therefore my breath was all out. Due to the fact I was not calculating a slow stop at the ground, I kept screaming and my breath was all out until the colision. then I hit the ground and woke up. This dream due to the fall adrenaline, became a lucid dream." In bufo... my energy/prana was all out right before finding my face. when, in my hand movements searching for the face the hands found themselves without finding the face. The orgasm of the universe happened. The face was not found by the hands but the hands colided. So, to practice this sutra, in the breath cicle divided by 4 (in, pause, out, pause) find the breath when it is all out at the same time you CONTINUOUSLY imagine yourself already there. To help, imagine yourself eternaly falling (because the vibration of the air movement in your nostrils is one of your subconcient tools to keep time for you) and in this eternal falling it is already the universal pause. The sensation of this falling is the same sensation of the breath going out without the curve upwards. Fell eternaly the sensation of only the breath out without the pause because everything else except the outgoing breath is the pause. If you ignore the upward breeath, your small self vanishes (because matter can only be ciclical and you are removing the other half of the breatbecause everything else except the outgoing breath is the pause. If you ignore the upward breeath, your small self vanishes (because matter can only be ciclical and you are removing the other half of the breathbecause everything else except the outgoing breath is the pause. If you ignore the upward breeath, your small self vanishes (because matter can only be ciclical and you are removing the other half of the breatbecause everything else except the outgoing breath is the pause. If you ignore the upward breeath, your small self vanishes (because matter can only be ciclical and you are removing the other half of the breatbecause everything else except the outgoing breath is the pause. If you ignore the upward breeath, your small self vanishes (because matter can only be ciclical and you are removing the other half of the breatbecause everything else except the outgoing breath is the pause. If you ignore the upward breeath, your small self vanishes (because matter can only be ciclical and you are removing the other half of the breath). Again: Step 1 - take a look at the drawing where the breath is divided in 4 aspects (inward, curve down, outward, curve up). Step 2 - If you think you have to find the pause in the turning point, it seems dificult. Therefore, if enlightenment is already there and is already your inner space, then something must be continuous without cicles. Step 3: Dissect the sensation you have of the air movement and the body feelings when the breath is going out before slowing down. The part of the out-going breath that is fast going down/out is what we need. Step 4 - Feel that sensation/notive that sensation constantly as if you could only breath out. Step 5 - each time out going breath happens, add energy to your vision of falling down, relaxing. Step 6 - Allow yourlself to forget the incoming breath, that is the only way your small self is able to vanish. The universal pause will happen this way because the inward breath will not be there, that itself is an absence, a pause!. \n\n In my bufo alvarius this was what was happening to me because I could not feel my self but could feel an eternal flow of energy. I felt the will to play and shout because there "was nobody there ouside of me, the room felt inexistent" and my energy was spread outside of my skin. Shiva says "when breath is all out (up)", so, when you exale relax into your centar (spine stight, sitting for exaple) and this way, if you get yourself imagining a free fall, the air is moving upwards only, therefor he says "when breath is all out (up)". \n\n One more thing. when practicing this tecknique, focus on the breath turn which is more convenient to you. The most convinient is the one breath that takes longer to slow down before starting turning in the opposite direction because it can be used by you to find your relaxation. Keep relaxing into your chair continuously and imagining the 2 paralell lines downwards, the eternal fall/out-breath plus the segment of out-breath that is extracted from the other 3 parts of the breath cicle. This one segment is what you must use as imagination to feel your longer eternal breath. Every sensation and vibration of the body is suposed to be felt as the air slaping on your face when falling in sky dive. \n\n In my bufo, there was a part where my hands kept tracking the face and found themselves. When they found themselves in the air above my head (I was lying down) They kept pressing on each other as is is was not the end of their movement. Of course, If my involuntary intention was to keep moving the hands, the phisically stoped by themselves because I commanded nothing, they colided alone. \n\n Also in my bufo, there I remember that when I smoked I knew I don't even know how long this experience could happen, I was aware that I did not knew when it would end.

   SS #11: In my imature experience, stopping the doors of the senses means: not to be rigid while perceiving the ant in the arm, instead, feel the ant as if it is in the center of your experience, in the center of your universe, because if that happens, you feel the energy (bhairav) but not the location of the creeping

   SS #14: Technique to use when yoy are in yhe bed trying to sleep but you are restless constantly moving without stopping, always unconfortable in each pisition... if yhat is the case you are at rest in some part of the body and without rest at some other part of the body... in yhat case, lock yourself lock your muscles in such a way that you rest in a tense form, you may be ywisted in the body, yor back may even be arched back or twisted some way, but you can find that assymetric looking pisition like a sheet of metal that gets crooked by either too hot water or too cold water.... the sheet of metal bends, this bending is the middle tentions betwwen the two temperatures... so when you are in the bed, decide to rest and in that rest you will find the urge to move to the second full rested position, start the movement to the second position but stop in the middle, stop in the middle of the two restfull pisitions and the only way to do that is by finding a certain disconfort... you know that you have found this sutra when the unconfortable position which is in the middle of the 2 restfull positions expend for each and every muscle of the body... if your whole body muscles contrubute to this positions, you will find yourself locked in the middle of the bhairava (the energy), in the middle of the two rest positions. At this point, dharana is the method described to find this midlle position. To find and ininterruptedly experience this full body tension in between two restfull positions, and the the energy you are putting out will be consumed until samadhi.... until ko energy is no more there, and you will find not  2 restfull positions + 1 restless positions, but 3 restfull positions.... samadhi; Is it possble that bharatanatyam dance would be good to practice this??

   SS #15 {

      Explanation from Nithyananda why some enlightned masters sever limbs of their disciples to get them enlightened:
         (he gives the meaning of tapas): - Tapas: Ready to work on the technique at any cost, any risk
                                          - Therefore this techmique is only for those whom enlightenment becomes FIRST priority

      A very good explanation of Maya is found in the video where Nithyananda explains this sutra
         (video: "Just Fall In - Shiva Sutras in Nithyananda Videos"; URL: https://youtu.be/Gkp2p7JVLB)
   }

   SS #25: Seiva created a script to ring a bell randomly at any time within 24 hours, and the person who is aware of the script/program, will stop as soon as the bell is rang. So, after this, there is a question... what to do if you stop and then you have the inpulse again of continuing your life and do something? Well, we must undertand that this sutra is a technique and is meant for you to be aware if the stopping, it is not for you to become lazy... therefore you definitly will continue with your life at some point. If life is really flowing and if at some point you feel yhat your life is goung to continue, than keep up the game of the shiva sutras (as per SS #110: "Gracious one, play...") and the script will suggest the sutra #108 to you the player where, before you continue to run your life, first you see where the flow of life is trying to pull you thowards

   SS #27: Maybe this is the origin of the Dance "Shiva Tandava"

   SS #28: My girlfriend is incapable of saying portuguese curse worfs like "cagalhão, fuck, hore, shit" etc... And I keep her in this zone where I spell each silable of each word and slowly, very slowly she joins each silable and pieces the deprivation I put her into. She says the first silable of a curse word and I wait for it to create a certain feeling in her mind... then I do the next for the next silable... The moment each silable of the word gains a new meaning, now, we join the together

   SS #29: Do you feel stuck somewhere or wuth something? devote yourself to the process, are you in jain? devote yourself to the process, devotions frees. Sadhguru sais in Inner Engeneer ans in Shambavi: "All the rules are my rules". Devotion may make you feel smaller, seeing everything bugger that you, in case your handcuffs start increasing in size where you are smaller and smaller, suddenly they may loose grip or your hands ang you may escape. God is definitly bigger, right?

   SS #35: In one sentence what I would say is: "Notice depth... either if it is a well of if it is masters's eyes"

   SS #35: Jusy as Lao Tzu taught his disciple: stay on this bridge and do not go out until river stops and bridgr moves.. At that moment you know the yin yang... but further continuing, go on changing your prespective from yin to yang, from yang to yin, from yin to yang until you see the snake wich is sushumna... the edge of the bridge will not be a straight line if you keep changing you eyes from yin to yang, yang to yin... your eyes will like you are drunk. Bridge moving + river sptoped = Ida. Bridge flowing + River moving = Pingala. The edge that separates both can be a fixed surface or a wave form, that is sushumna

   SS #38: From nithyananda videos (for example: Silence Within || Part 2 || Shiva Sutras || 25 May 2007 (https://youtu.be/Id8EqNKoOKI)) we can understan why shiva wears the ganga in his head... it is because soud is eternal and shiva in in the center of it. BATHE IN THE CENTER OF SOUND, because at each moment sound exists.
   
   SS #38: This is one of those techniques you can practice EVERY where, even in the market place
   
   SS 40: the expression of slowly singing this bajhan in the beggining (https://youtu.be/i7B4SspgC0w) shows the bliss in her face. A bajhan is an oportunity to use the music to refine our voice pitches

   SS #42: The best sound I know for this, is the bansuri sound that Nithyananda has at the end of his videos

   SS #44: The origin of the zen koan: Find out the sound of one hand clapping

   SS #63: This is the sutra where I can say "My cat, my guru" because my cat called Buakaw (like the muay thai fighter) climbed on my leg while I was meditating and I relaxed my naked leg to the cats claws.... and pretending the cat was ME, Something in my being swaped and I became the cat's fur. This was with the greay cat to whome I gave paliative care..... I think this is what Alan Watts talks about "thr sindrome of the holy man" where a person ser all events around himself as if he is doing it all. As if he is GOD. To try it, when listening to somebody's voice, listen as if is is you who are talking and a sincronicity will be such that you cannot distinguish if it is you or not

   SS #72: Seiva Sais: I don't know if this sutra is sutable for what sadhguru says os not. BUT... If the sutra mentions the living presence of the cosmos, then I think this sutra is sutable for the question to sadhguru about what to do with mountain sized karmas. He's answer about huge amounts of karma was: " -Even if you himalayan size karma, inverse the equation and use this complexity.... instead of passion thowards you and dispassion toward other, no..... total passion about everything else (every other life), total dispassion about this one (refering to ourself)" - Video: With sadhguru in challenging times - day22 Apr"" 

   SS #72: Me, David Santos Rodrigues(who is calling himself Seiva D'arve) had a technique as a kid to experience this sutra: I was very religious with christianity at that time and I heard a priest criticising "Hey, notice that people only remember God and only start praying when they find themselves in some trouble. Why don't you thank God in all sorts of situations and places?" From that moment, When I find myself in any place where the situation is not rotine, when the situation is in some way weird and unexpected, I started feel thankfull for existing is such place and is such condition and for not beeing sick or getting sick despite the current weird situation around me.
"
   SS #75: The best compliment you can give to a person is the imitate. This sutra aparently talks about Autenticity, the ability of being our best version... If somebody misbehaves about one of your attitudes that was not pleasent for them and block you from there life, do not immitate this gesture by blocking back, instead, be a permanent light to the world... allow the other perso to go throw yhe rubber band effect and come back or, if the person does not come back, you can still decide to shine some light on their life... This behavious will give you tremendous joy... you will live by joy and autenticity instead of imitation. If somebody slaps you, add the same behaviour to your life only if you find that such attitude would be a joyfull attitude to apply to every body. If you find such attitude pleasent, give a slap back, otherwise, be a light and an example. People who are unaware of joy tend to be imitate. I suggest you imitation only that wich is the best

   SS #83: It isn't your body that speaks first, it is your mind. Notice that
   
   SS #86: The Nithyananda's video of this is the technique is what makes you move always, each second you are a new person, Therefore this explains the psycdelic trips of fishes with eyes and jesus fishes images, or even the vesica piescis of jesus

   SS #101: Seiva translates this sutra as: "Believe omniscient, omnipotent, permeating, perculating everywhere.." And when we deal with dumb people from the village, we feel the lack of knowing from them, like if inteligence is not yet reaching it's depts.... Another way of seeing this dumb people with stone like brains is to see that their rock like brain is a building block for a bigger scale of "small" particles that we, the observer, cannot yet step in because we are too thin for this rock like scale 

   SS #102: Imagine is GOD can see you and your mistake even if you hide. Like if you steal a bottle of wine and go hide in a barn... Even if nobody knows, imagine that GOD (spirit) knows

   SS #104: Whatever you are experiencing right now visually and with every other sense, take a snapshot of it and keep it until you absorb everything

   SS #106: Sadhguru explains this sutra in inner engeneering as: "I am responsible for everything". Seiva Says: this is the sutra for marriage without burocracy wich is the true marriage
            This is the reason Seiva is with his consort, not because he needs, but because Isaura is beeing treted has him. He left concern for himself and took care of her.

   SS #107: Doesn't the sutra mean that everything is an "eye" of consciousness? each being is this consciousness, right? isn't each vertice of each object one point of consciousness? (just like one of my salvia trips where the wall had eyes)

   SS #108: The TAO, Wu-Wei is the allowance of the individual for the body to freely float along the river... if you leave your body to float with the river, you experience one level of Wu-wei, the TAO... the same way... if you perceive your body's tendencies and routines as if you are simply watching a log of a tree floating along the path of least resistence, now, you see the spirit of guidance... Osho describes in his experience of enlightenment "I felt the power of God, I was not there, God was there... and I went at 1 am in yhr night to a garden where I used to go and I climbed the gate as a thief, I had to do it, I was nit there, God was there". (Osho Words are not those exactly, please watch: https://youtu.be/oqXYUiWVlkU)

   SS #109: Salvia divinorum gives you this one

   SS #112: This sutra describes what Nithyananda calls "Kailash"

   Names of shiva: "Asudosha: Easily pleased (meaning that you don't need much to please him)"

}

SS #2 {
   - Nithyananda sais in the video that one of Shiva's qualities is "Asudosha", what ever tje society rejects, Shiva accepts, he is pleased with very small things
   - Nithyananda confirms in this
}

Shiva Sutra #7 {
   > With intangible breath in center of forehead, as this reaches the heart at the moment of sleep, have direction over dreams and over death itself.

   video by Nithyananda: "Shiva Sutras Death Demystified" (https://youtu.be/beqUPL4Y2tg)

   - This sutra explains perfectly what by mistake, Seiva experienced at the hospital during army burnout. He tried this sutra during the night and he experienced the death state, he experienced 2 realities at the same time

   Nithyananda: "prana means air energy"
   
   Seiva: something to try: did you ever see a kid trying to sleep sitting down with its head straight? and starting to hit the wall with the head over and over and over? Well: at the moment where you feel so sleepy that your neck starts to wave like a snake, do the sutra. At that moment, head is free falling... stopping... free falling... stopping... yin... yang... yin... yang... ... KEEP YOUR REMAINING wakefull attention in such free fall

   Nithyananda ecplains why spiritual people are called as "reborn" or "borned again" just like jesus said. He explains in his video at min (40:30)

Shiva Sutra #20 {
   Seiva says: Fill the whole car like a statue, still, if you keep you center of mass in line between a strong base and a light head, experience. When you cook bread and you swirl the bread around the container with a certain amount of flour, the uncooked bread can experience the same as you. For the second part of the sutra, you can watch toy story movie at the part where Jessie introduces woody. The woodie's walk with style is an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkojrVKj-s
   seiva says: "in a stil vehicle, in slowing invisible circles" I think it means that the vehicle must have springs yo bounce a little bit
   
   Seiva says: Vivekananda got enlightened by his guru with this technique: the guru asked if the had the courage to sit. vivekanada sat and the guru put one feet one his chest. by rithmically swaying him, the experience. video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pviWGX7bLF4

   # uDev: Create a script at home stereo system: Randomly whistle a sound. The moment you listen to the sound, you must STOP completly without adjusting! (Just like Nithyananda told in his video). Sugestion for sound: rattle snake sound

Shiva Sutra #28 {

   Nithyananda YouTube video: He says that the sutra itself how it is presented in this list, is a commantary of an enlightened master Abhinavagupta at the 9th century and the sanskrit translation of the sutra is: "Having meditated on the gross and weak shakti in "vada sha endrias" (12 endrias) thus making it subtle, one who enters the heart space and meditates there attains mukti, becomes liberated and takes a quantum jump into ultimate consciousness"

-- Nithyananda says that you cannot separate the master from his experience. If you try to have the experience of the master and reject part of his way of life, the you are in trouble... a master is anybody who can reproduce his experience, so if you follow a master and you want to experience his experience, then you should not reject any aspect of his being... Shiva cannot be separated from shiva sutras, he was teaching them while he was at that moment experiencing them. (That also defines a master, because false masters tell you to practice or do things that they themselves do not do. So, if such practice was so important how is that, that such so called "masters" did not yet strive to embibe and live that way? At this point you distinguish from opinion to mastery). If you do not reject any aspect of shiva's way of life, you may experience the full shiva sutras (so what are his qualities?? how did he dress for each ocasion? try that)... So if you try to behave like shiva in order to experience his experience of life, then there are something else I would like to notice. Sadhguru said that Shiva did not spill is seed, his sperm, because it is used to reach the peak of consciousness... The fundamental vital energy in the system, instead of spilling it, letting it go in a physical manner which would lead to reproduction, he used the same energy to reach the peak of consciousness. He spilled from the top of his head. When a human being is not involved in the reproductive process, naturally his attachment to the body is very minimal. Once his attachment to the body is very minimal, the sense of fear does not exist. When there is no fear, he is naturaly a valiant. That is the consequence of this. (Youtube video where sadhguru tells this: https://youtu.be/G6anZKkPOYM) - Seiva D'Arve
-- Sadhguru sais that these shiva sutras were transpired between 2 people with utmost intimacy, not in terms of sexuality, it means that there was no resustance between the two. Devi was open to whay is being offered. Video: https://youtube.com/shorts/FgBjInkwopA?feature=share
